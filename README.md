# ATM-machine
Service for communication between the ATM machine and the user.


All communication takes place through the console.
Before entering the program, user must log in (passwords in the program are (kinda) encrypted).
After authorization, user can request information about the amount of money in the ATM (all available currency, the number of currency bills and their denomination will be displayed);
Also user can deposit and withdraw money (greedy algorithm) in the terminal, providing currency, denomination and the number of bills;

Service keeps track of the amount of money in the ATM, but not on the user's account.
